1. The main report (AVOID_WS2_D1_26 China energy technology options to 2050) and appendix (AVOID_WS2_D1_26 China energy technology options to 2050 ANNEXES) for the AVOID “China’s energy technology options to 2050” project, in which the applicant co-authored the Transport section.  

2. An Excel file (ChinaRoadTransportEmissionsCostModel_2015) that was used to produce results for the Applied Energy paper in PDF (AppliedEnergy_ReduceChinaRoadEmissions2050) titled "Reducing China's road transport sector CO2 emissions to 2050: Technologies, costs and decomposition analysis". This paper is a follow-up work of the AVOID project, with new model focused on abatement costs of different technology.
